Program README

--Setup--

In order to set up the program, The developer or user in question will need to download the application either from GitHub or from its ZIP file state. Then the user/developer can unzip the project files and open up the program in 
Visual studios. The web application was written in C# code language using a ASP.NET MVC architecture (for users, this is not important to know)

It is important for the developers to note that there is a azure database connected to the application and the database is managed through SQL server manager. If you wish to use the database, the logins are 
userID = ST1045492 and password = DoomsD@yDevice5. Be sure to change login credentials frequently for security purposes.

Other than that, there shouldnt be any build problems to struggle with. The connection with the database is established in the code so there is no need for more labor on the developer's side.

--User and admin roles--

In the program users can publish their own products onto the web app! Users create their own accounts and log into them to see their current listings.
In addition to seeing their current listings, users can create, edit and delete their listings.

Admins on the site have more priveledges than users. They are able to log in as normal users however they have a separate log in page
for if they wish to log in as a admin. Normal users' credentials will not be able to continue through this login page. Admins are able
to view ALL listings on the web app including their own and other user's listings.

In addition to being able to see all the listings, admins are also able to manage the users. When getting to the User List, Admins
can create, delete and edit users. Users will never be able to get admin status themselves which is why in the User list, admins
can edit other users' admin status. 

--conclusions--
The app shouldnt be too difficult to use and to set up however if there are
extended problems, please contact me @ChristoffelPetruskr@gmail.com
